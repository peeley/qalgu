<h1> About Qalgu </h1>
    <p> This project is a research project by Noah Snelson for the Undergraduate Research and Student Activity
    (URSA) program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This website is a technical demonstration of a
    subset of artificial intelligence concerned with language translation, known as neural machine translation.
    </p>
    <p> Neither the creator of this website nor the algorithm producing the translations knows the Inupiaq language
    semantically. Rather, the algorithm learns to translate as it is given data in the form of samples of English
    and their translations into Inupiaq. If you would like to know more about this algorithm or the theory behind
    it, you can find the research paper <a href="">here</a>.</p>
    <p> This website and the algorithm behind it is also 100% open-source, and if you'd like to check it out or
    contribute, you can find the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/peeley/nlp">here</a> and
